# CubeField.LayoutForm property (Excel)

Returns or sets the way the specified PivotTable items appearâ€”in table format or in outline format. Read/write **[XlLayoutFormType](Excel.XlLayoutFormType.md)**.


## Syntax

_expression_.**LayoutForm**

_expression_ A variable that represents a **[CubeField](Excel.CubeField.md)** object.


## Remarks

You can set this property for any PivotTable field; however, the formatting appears only if the specified field is a row field other than the innermost (lowest-level) row field. 

For non-OLAP data sources, the value of this property doesn't change when the field is rearranged or when it is added to or removed from the PivotTable report.


## Example

This example displays the state field in the first PivotTable report on the active worksheet in outline format, and it displays the subtotals at the top of the field.

```vb
With ActiveSheet.PivotTables("PivotTable1") _ 
 .PivotFields("state") 
 .LayoutForm = xlOutline 
 .LayoutSubtotalLocation = xlTop 
End With
```
