# Permission.PermissionFromPolicy property (Office)

Gets a **Boolean** value that indicates whether a permission policy has been applied to the active document. Read-only.


## Syntax

_expression_.**PermissionFromPolicy**

_expression_ A variable that represents a **[Permission](Office.Permission.md)** object.


## Remarks

Information Rights Management in Microsoft Office supports the use of administrative permission policies that list users and groups and their document permissions. The **PermissionFromPolicy** property returns a **Boolean** value that indicates whether a permission policy was applied to the active document the last time permissions were enabled on the document.

The **PermissionFromPolicy** property always returns **False** when checked by a non-owner of the document, even when the user has object model permissions.


## Example

The following example displays permission policy information about the active document.


```vb
 Dim irmPermission As Office.Permission 
 Dim strIRMInfo As String 
 Set irmPermission = ActiveWorkbook.Permission 
 If irmPermission.Enabled Then 
 strIRMInfo = "Permissions are restricted on this document." & vbCrLf 
 If irmPermission.PermissionFromPolicy Then 
 strIRMInfo = strIRMInfo & " Permissions applied from policy:" & vbCrLf & _ 
 " Policy name: " & irmPermission.PolicyName & vbCrLf & _ 
 " Policy description: " & irmPermission.PolicyDescription 
 Else 
 strIRMInfo = strIRMInfo & " Default permissions applied." & vbCrLf & _ 
 " Default policy name: " & irmPermission.PolicyName & vbCrLf & _ 
 " Default policy description: " & irmPermission.PolicyDescription 
 End If 
 Else 
 strIRMInfo = "Permission are NOT restricted on this document." 
 End If 
 MsgBox strIRMInfo, vbInformation + vbOKOnly, "IRM Information" 
 Set irmPermission = Nothing 

```
