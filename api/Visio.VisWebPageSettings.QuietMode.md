# VisWebPageSettings.QuietMode property

Determines whether dialog boxes are displayed in the Visio user interface when you save a drawing as a webpage. Read/write.


## Syntax

_expression_.**QuietMode**

_expression_ An expression that returns a **[VisWebPageSettings](Visio.VisWebPageSettings.md)** object.


## Return value

**Long**


## Remarks

Set **QuietMode** to a non-zero value (**True**) to prevent modal dialog boxes from appearing in the user interface when a drawing is saved as a webpage; set it to zero (**False**) to display dialog boxes with default settings. The default is **False**.

Setting the **QuietMode** property to **True** prevents modal dialog boxes from appearing in the Microsoft Visio user interface; however, the **Save As Web Page** progress bar is displayed while the page is being created.

To prevent the user interface from appearing entirely, use the **[SilentMode](Visio.VisWebPageSettings.SilentMode.md)** property.

If both the **QuietMode** and **SilentMode** properties are set to **True**, the **SilentMode** property takes precedence, and no user interface is displayed.


## Example

The following macro shows how to set the **QuietMode** property to **True** before saving the drawing as a webpage. Setting this value to **True** prevents modal dialog boxes from appearing in the user interfaceâ€”only the progress bar appears. Because the **[OpenBrowser](Visio.VisWebPageSettings.OpenBrowser.md)** property is set to **True**, the drawing opens in the browser.

Before running this macro, replace `path\filename.htm` with a valid target path on your computer and the filename that you want to assign to your webpage.

```vb
Public Sub QuietMode_Example() 
 Dim vsoSaveAsWeb As VisSaveAsWeb 
 Dim vsowebSettings As VisWebPageSettings 
 
 Set vsoSaveAsWeb = Visio.Application.SaveAsWebObject 
 Set vsoWebSettings = vsoSaveAsWeb.WebPageSettings 
 
 With vsoWebSettings 
 .QuietMode = True 
 .OpenBrowser = True 
 .TargetPath = "path\filename.htm" 
 End With 
 
 vsoSaveAsWeb.CreatePages 
End Sub
```
